  <blockquote>
		

  ```lua 
    print"Thanks for take a look at my profile"
  ```



  **Joke, here you have a few old lua examples I have projects in roblox to:**



  - Game that I tried to make with my friends years ago,I used löve2d and I made all things XD, they don't help me but I maded a model with blender and then I made a pixel render for it and I create a "menu". Its that all XD, is cool to see. Take a look [here](https://github.com/abdedarghal111/Failed-game). Here you have a image of the animated menu, the title and the ship are animated.

  - This is a simple animation I made like a joke for my friend. Its like a bouncing head. The easy code is [here](https://github.com/abdedarghal111/Juank-animation).

  (https://github.com/abdedarghal111/Done-flappy-bird-with-lot-of-bugs).
    - I made the music.
    - I made the coding.
    - I designed all.
    - Basicly I maded all, is better than I expected years ago XD.

   - If you want see more löve2d stuff, I have really old projects that they are not ended but they work well, they are pretty simple but I still like them. [Here](https://github.com/abdedarghal111/first-love2d-projects) a repo of a library with all that.

   - I maded so many projects with roblox studio engine, you can try some games I published:
     - My first game, I learned lua making it, it's a classic obby like other roblox games, click [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/5223851354/Mysterious-tower-obby).
     - This is a game I maded for a gamejam with 2 team mates, I was the director, scripter and I added the sounds too in that game. It was a cool idea and funny to make, see [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/7109145912/Cajas-Expr-s).
     - Finally, my lastest is a obby I maded, with a different system in every level, and a final boss, with the goal of improve my programming skills. See [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/8211332465/Christmass-obby).

## Thats all for now:
  - That all my projects for now, in my personal opinion I think I am not a real programmer because I didn't learn from official institutions but fortunately I'll be starting to study a higher degree in web application development that lasts 2 years in my high school for official certification.
